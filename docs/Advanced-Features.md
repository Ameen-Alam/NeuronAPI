## Production Deployment

NeuronAPI provides built-in support for deploying to production environments using **Docker** and **Terraform**.

### Deploying with Terraform:
- You can generate Terraform scripts for AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud using the CLI:
  ```bash
  python cli.py deploy production
  ```

This will create the necessary infrastructure files for Kubernetes or serverless environments.

## CI/CD Integration
- NeuronAPI works with CI/CD systems like **GitHub Actions** for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- Example CI/CD pipeline:
  ```yaml
  name: NeuronAPI CI

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
