# API Documentation

NeuronAPI provides auto-generated API docs via **Swagger** and **ReDoc**.

Once your services are running, you can access the API documentation:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

These interfaces allow you to explore and interact with your API endpoints in real time.
