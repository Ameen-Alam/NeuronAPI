# NeuronAPI

Welcome to **NeuronAPI**, an AI-driven orchestration framework that simplifies the creation and management of microservices.

## What is NeuronAPI?

NeuronAPI is a lightweight, async-first framework built on top of FastAPI and Docker to help developers:
- Easily generate and manage **microservices**.
- Integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for dynamic service generation.
- Seamlessly orchestrate complex microservice-based architectures with **Kafka** and **Postgres**.

## Key Features:
- **FastAPI Integration**: Leverages FastAPI for high-performance APIs.
- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Automatically create microservices with minimal code.
- **Microservices Orchestration**: Ready-to-use Docker and Kafka setup for asynchronous communication.
- **Cloud-Ready Deployments**: Built-in support for Terraform and Docker Compose to scale from local to production.

NeuronAPI is designed for developers and organizations looking to streamline their microservice creation while integrating AI to assist with dynamic code generation.
